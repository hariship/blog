  <p class="intro">
    It's been a bit of a ride—some days slower, some a little heavy. But in between cleaning things out, picking up small habits, and quiet resets, I've been finding my rhythm again.
  </p>
  <hr/>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>I have been using <a href="https://ticktick.com/?language=en_US">TickTick</a> regularly for the past three months—mostly to keep track of tasks. Over time, it became a habit that I decided to go for the premium plan at ₹250 a month (which is not bad and I may unsubscribe next month). The seamless sync across devices makes the whole experience smoother. Below is my monthly stats.</p>

      <p>Cleaning has always helped me clear my mind and find focus. Lately, weekends have become a loop of tidying and resetting—I also rearranged my wardrobe to have to only 10 paired outfits for work. Around the same time, I also joined a <a href="https://livingartlife.com/dot-mandala-art/">dot mandala</a> workshop with my friend Vidhya at HSR. The repetition felt so calming—much like cleaning. I enjoyed it so much that I purchased the tools <a href="https://www.amazon.in/Mandala-Painting-Designer-Acrylic-Dotting/dp/B0BTTS9V47/ref=asc_df_B0BTTS9V47/?tag=googleshopdes-21&linkCode=df0&hvadid=710045259325&hvpos=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=10463480567262150436&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9062008&hvtargid=pla-1966090086691&psc=1&mcid=4362b389145c3186a7cb141ba14e8deb&tag=googleshopdes-21&linkCode=df0&hvadid=710045259325&hvpos=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=10463480567262150436&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9062008&hvtargid=pla-1966090086691&psc=1&gad_source=1">online</a> and did it again the next week at home for a pot. All it really takes is a geometry box, some pencils, dotting tools, paint, and a bit more patience.</p>

      <p>Work has been running good lately. I've noticed I solve bugs better in the mornings than at night, which works well since our standup's usually happen at 9 AM(on alternative days). I've also made a shift to work from Awfis, and if the weather holds up, I may try cycling to workspace as its nearby to my house (~2KM).</p>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      <p><a href="">Published</a> a blog on <a href="https://www.knowledgekeeper.ai/">KK</a> recently. It's something I've been dipping in and out of, but over the next two weeks, I'm planning to give it a bit more attention and hopefully get a basic version out. Let's see how it shapes up.</p>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      <p>As Krish Ashok said in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAwZHtkuza8">podcast</a>, being on a platform with 250 million people and their emotions is like holding a beer all the time—maybe okay once in a while, but harmful if you consume it every day. So I moved Social media apps(like X, Instagram etc, except Youtube) to another device. Now it's not part of my daily scroll at-least.</p>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      <p>On that note, I did the painful task of clearing out my inbox. It had gotten really crowded over time and has kind of become a yearly routine now. I enjoy getting weekly newsletters and blog updates, so I moved all my subscriptions under one label. That felt like a relief!</p>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      <p>We visited <a href="https://thepack.in/articles/thepack-reviews-neralu-organic-orchards-dog-park-in-bangalore">Neralu</a> one of the weekends with our friends in the apartment, and it was such a joy to see Tars jump into the lake on his own this time—no push needed. He looked much more comfortable in the water, and watching him paddle around happily was the best part of the trip.</p>

      About 2 weeks back the full text RSS feed from wix has been <a href="https://forum.wixstudio.com/t/our-full-text-rss-feed-using-blog-feed-xml-stopped-working/69535">stopped working</a> (looks intended!). So this post of mine is just baked as a simple text reader.

        <p>The past couple of weeks have been a mix of movement and pause—some travel, slow catch-ups, lots of learning, and a few changes along the way.</p>
        <hr/>
        <ul>
            <li>Been trying out a few AI tools. I also learned about MCP <a href="https://youtu.be/7j_NE6Pjv-E?si=nBdQo9apsPH92xHl">(Model Context Protocol)</a> and found a great explanation that finally clicked. It's exciting how MCP can standardise context sharing and reduce LLM hallucinations.</li>
            <li>I added a subscription button to my blog—top right corner of the home. A friend asked for it, so I waited until it felt useful. If you subscribe now, you'll start getting newsletters from my next post onward.
                <ul>
                    <li>I moved my email backend to <a href="https://resend.com/">Resend</a>. Integration was smooth and the service feels really light. No unnecessary bloat, just works.</li>
                    <li>Finally made the switch from Wix to <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/">cloudfare </a>for hosting. Pages load faster and I have more control now. The difference is noticeable.</li>
                    <li>Planning to move my infra from AWS to Netlify soon. It'll simplify deployment and integrate better with the rest of my setup.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Learning something new takes effort. It's not always joyful—sometimes it's also takes pain. Wrote a <a href="https://blog.haripriya.org/post/learning-in-the-noise-the-art-of-filtering">post</a> about it.</li>
            <li>Been enjoying others' weekly notes too. Found <strong>Pradx</strong> via Thejesh's blogring. His posts are thoughtful. One X quote he shared really stuck with me.
                <ul>
                    <li><em>Interesting X thread by Conor White-Sullivan that has a provocative start in the post, <a href="https://x.com/Conaw/status/1902423274002510244">"If your AI won't help you break the law, it doesn't belong to you, it belongs to those who make its laws"</em></a></li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>We try a lot of tools, but what works is what the whole team is comfortable using. We migrated completely to Notion recently, and I like their templates.</li>
            <li>Being misunderstood is more common than we think—it's almost the default. Being truly seen and understood, though, feels rare and fleeting. I'm learning not to chase it too hard and instead find peace in expressing myself anyway.</li>
            <li>This week I co-worked with Yash and we had a long conversation on how money works. I learnt about the petrodollar system, Ponzi schemes, and the Bretton Woods Agreement. Ref <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZHLGrV8Fvo&pp=ygUYaG93IGJyZW50d29vZCBzY2hlbSB3b3Jr">here</a> for me. Wild, how economics shapes so much around us.</li>

            <li>I've been on and off with travel lately, and I'm heading to Chennai again this week. Tars has been extra clingy, he's clearly been missing me. In between all that movement, I had a really good, slow weekend with Vidhya after almost five years. It felt grounding—one of those weekends that lifted me up.</li>

    <p>There's a moment I often find myself in: standing in front of a buffet with more food than I need. Everything looks inviting, full of variety. I take a bit of everything, thinking I'll enjoy it. But halfway through, I already feel full, sometimes even uneasy, wondering why I didn't choose what I wanted in the first place.</p>
  </div>
      <p>That's what the internet feels like to me these days.</p>
  <hr/>

  <div class="section">
    <p><blockquote style="font-style: italic; border-left: 4px solid #ccc; padding-left: 16px; margin: 20px 0; color: #555;">
      I often think or write about the constant consumption we engage in every day: news, social media, trends, tech. It feels endless. While access is easy, my mind, even after four coffees, is slower to process it all. The clutter builds quickly.
    </blockquote></p>

    <p>Many times, I step back. Quit social media. Turn off notifications. Try to find silence. And then, the urge to stay updated kicks in. I dive back in, consume everything, and soon feel overwhelmed. The mood shifts sometimes subtly, sometimes all at once.</p>

    <p>I used to think I could solve it by making better choices—but even choosing can get exhausting. So, I started consuming less. Followed fewer people. Stopped clicking every link. I try not to let algorithms steer me all the time. But I've realised this isn't something that these detoxes can fix. It needs steady, ongoing care—like what your liver does to your body each day.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <p>But, <b>I still want to learn</b>. In fact, learning feels more important than ever and it needs space and time, with some fun and mostly grounding.</p>

    <p>There is something my friend Ram shared about learning from a sub-reddit.</p>
    <img src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/2402dd_9045f2e88e3b47a7a108b1c47a9b6937~mv2.jpeg/v1/fill/w_1089,h_1600,al_c,q_85,enc_avif,quality_auto/2402dd_9045f2e88e3b47a7a108b1c47a9b6937~mv2.jpeg">
    <p>I like the analogy about "mental equivalent of sweating". Learning is not just about absorbing something new. It often asks for discomfort as it often constructs a neural pathway, and with more practice, a stronger circuit, much like a muscle.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <p>I am usually slow at learning new languages. My piano classes often remind me that the pleasure of playing is real, but so is the struggle to stay with the process. Focus doesn't always feel rewarding in the moment. But without it, the joy doesn't really land. So, when my mind is already cluttered or overstimulated, it starts reaching for easier rewards—like a scroll, a headline, or a short video or reels. In that state, real learning struggles to settle in.</p>

    <p>So, I have started to keep my plate light. I explore during certain times in the day, only when my mind is clear or curious. It's like food, you need it daily, but you don't want to eat heavy meals at odd hours. Especially as I age, I don't want to consume just because it was pushed to me. I want to make a choice, when I really have the space.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <p>Some days, I still slip. And that's okay. But I always return to this idea: a quiet plate, a healthy but lighter meal, enough space to think, and a few intentional bites at a time. I still have fun with social media, like drinking or eating a heavy meal, but they have become more of intentional bites, which has its dedicated time, because when I make such rooms, learning finds its way back in.</p>
