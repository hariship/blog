  <p class="intro">
    It's been a bit of a ride—some days slower, some a little heavy. But in between cleaning things out, picking up small habits, and quiet resets, I've been finding my rhythm again.
  </p>
  <hr/>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>I have been using <a href="https://ticktick.com/?language=en_US">TickTick</a> regularly for the past three months—mostly to keep track of tasks. Over time, it became a habit that I decided to go for the premium plan at ₹250 a month (which is not bad and I may unsubscribe next month). The seamless sync across devices makes the whole experience smoother. Below is my monthly stats.</p>

      <p>Cleaning has always helped me clear my mind and find focus. Lately, weekends have become a loop of tidying and resetting—I also rearranged my wardrobe to have to only 10 paired outfits for work. Around the same time, I also joined a <a href="https://livingartlife.com/dot-mandala-art/">dot mandala</a> workshop with my friend Vidhya at HSR. The repetition felt so calming—much like cleaning. I enjoyed it so much that I purchased the tools <a href="https://www.amazon.in/Mandala-Painting-Designer-Acrylic-Dotting/dp/B0BTTS9V47/ref=asc_df_B0BTTS9V47/?tag=googleshopdes-21&linkCode=df0&hvadid=710045259325&hvpos=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=10463480567262150436&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9062008&hvtargid=pla-1966090086691&psc=1&mcid=4362b389145c3186a7cb141ba14e8deb&tag=googleshopdes-21&linkCode=df0&hvadid=710045259325&hvpos=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=10463480567262150436&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9062008&hvtargid=pla-1966090086691&psc=1&gad_source=1">online</a> and did it again the next week at home for a pot. All it really takes is a geometry box, some pencils, dotting tools, paint, and a bit more patience.</p>

      <p>Work has been running good lately. I've noticed I solve bugs better in the mornings than at night, which works well since our standup's usually happen at 9 AM(on alternative days). I've also made a shift to work from Awfis, and if the weather holds up, I may try cycling to workspace as its nearby to my house (~2KM).</p>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      <p><a href="">Published</a> a blog on <a href="https://www.knowledgekeeper.ai/">KK</a> recently. It's something I've been dipping in and out of, but over the next two weeks, I'm planning to give it a bit more attention and hopefully get a basic version out. Let's see how it shapes up.</p>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      <p>As Krish Ashok said in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAwZHtkuza8">podcast</a>, being on a platform with 250 million people and their emotions is like holding a beer all the time—maybe okay once in a while, but harmful if you consume it every day. So I moved Social media apps(like X, Instagram etc, except Youtube) to another device. Now it's not part of my daily scroll at-least.</p>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      <p>On that note, I did the painful task of clearing out my inbox. It had gotten really crowded over time and has kind of become a yearly routine now. I enjoy getting weekly newsletters and blog updates, so I moved all my subscriptions under one label. That felt like a relief!</p>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      <p>We visited <a href="https://thepack.in/articles/thepack-reviews-neralu-organic-orchards-dog-park-in-bangalore">Neralu</a> one of the weekends with our friends in the apartment, and it was such a joy to see Tars jump into the lake on his own this time—no push needed. He looked much more comfortable in the water, and watching him paddle around happily was the best part of the trip.</p>
      <img src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/2402dd_95197ea0f38c47f2bd6404ad04a8e524~mv2.jpg/v1/fill/w_1170,h_1341,al_c,q_85,enc_auto/2402dd_95197ea0f38c47f2bd6404ad04a8e524~mv2.jpg" alt="Tars at the lake">

    <li>
      About 2 weeks back the full text RSS feed from wix has been <a href="https://forum.wixstudio.com/t/our-full-text-rss-feed-using-blog-feed-xml-stopped-working/69535">stopped working</a> (looks intended!). So this post of mine is just baked as a simple text reader.

        <p>The past couple of weeks have been a mix of movement and pause—some travel, slow catch-ups, lots of learning, and a few changes along the way.</p>
        <hr/>
        <ul>
            <li>Been trying out a few AI tools. I also learned about MCP <a href="https://youtu.be/7j_NE6Pjv-E?si=nBdQo9apsPH92xHl">(Model Context Protocol)</a>. It's exciting how it standardises context sharing and reduce LLM hallucinations. This is an exciting time for tech enthusiasts.</li>
            <li>I added a <b>subscription</b> service to my blog—top right corner of my <a href="https://blog.haripriya.org">homepage</a>. A friend asked for it, so I waited until it felt useful. If you subscribe now, you'll start getting newsletters from my next post onward.
                <ul>
                    <li>I moved my email backend to <a href="https://resend.com/">Resend</a>. Integration was smooth and the service feels really light.</li>
                    <li>Finally made the switch from Wix to <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/">cloudfare </a>for hosting. Pages load faster and I have more control now. The difference is noticeable.</li>
                    <li>Planning to move my infra from AWS to Netlify soon. It'll simplify deployment and integrate better with the rest of my setup.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Learning something new takes effort. It's not always joyful—sometimes it's also takes pain. Wrote a <a href="https://blog.haripriya.org/post/learning-in-the-noise-the-art-of-filtering">post</a> about it.</li>
            <li>Been enjoying others' weekly notes too. Found <a href="https://pradx.in/">Pradx</a> via Thejesh's blogring. His posts are thoughtful. One X quote he shared really stuck with me.
                <ul>
                    <li><em>Interesting X thread by Conor White-Sullivan that has a provocative start in the post, <a href="https://x.com/Conaw/status/1902423274002510244">"If your AI won't help you break the law, it doesn't belong to you, it belongs to those who make its laws"</em></a></li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Being misunderstood is more common than we think—it's almost the default. Being understood is rare and special. I'm learning not to chase it too hard and instead find peace in expressing myself anyway.</li>
            <li>This week I co-worked with Yash and we had a long conversation on how money works. I learnt about the petrodollar system, Ponzi schemes, and the Bretton Woods Agreement. Ref <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZHLGrV8Fvo&pp=ygUYaG93IGJyZW50d29vZCBzY2hlbSB3b3Jr">here</a>. Wild, how economics shapes so much around us.</li>

            <li>I've been on and off with travel lately, and I'm heading to Chennai again this week. Tars has been extra clingy, he's clearly been missing me. In between all that movement, I had a really good, slow weekend with Vidhya after almost five years. It felt grounding—one of those weekends that lifted me up.</li>

    <p>There's a moment I often find myself in: standing in front of a buffet with more food than I need. Everything looks inviting, full of variety. I take a bit of everything, thinking I'll enjoy it. But halfway through, I already feel full, sometimes even uneasy, wondering why I didn't choose what I wanted in the first place.</p>
  </div>
      <p>That's what the internet feels like to me these days.</p>
  <hr/>

  <div class="section">
    <p><blockquote style="font-style: italic; border-left: 4px solid #ccc; padding-left: 16px; margin: 20px 0; color: #555;">
      I often think or write about the constant consumption we engage in every day: news, social media, trends, tech. It feels endless. While access is easy, my mind, even after four coffees, is slower to process it all. The clutter builds quickly.
    </blockquote></p>

    <p>Many times, I step back. Quit social media. Turn off notifications. Try to find silence. And then, the urge to stay updated kicks in. I dive back in, consume everything, and soon feel overwhelmed. The mood shifts sometimes subtly, sometimes all at once.</p>

    <p>I used to think I could solve it by making better choices—but even choosing can get exhausting. So, I started consuming less. Followed fewer people. Stopped clicking every link. I try not to let algorithms steer me all the time. But I've realised this isn't something that these detoxes can fix. It needs steady, ongoing care—like what your liver does to your body each day.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <p>But, <b>I still want to learn</b>. In fact, learning feels more important than ever and it needs space and time, with some fun and mostly grounding.</p>
    <img src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/2402dd_d5e634982e9246a4b97c0910cafbc496~mv2.png/v1/fill/w_1024,h_1024,al_c,q_90,enc_avif,quality_auto/2402dd_d5e634982e9246a4b97c0910cafbc496~mv2.png">
    <p>There is something my friend Ram shared about learning from a sub-reddit.</p>
    <img src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/2402dd_9045f2e88e3b47a7a108b1c47a9b6937~mv2.jpeg/v1/fill/w_1089,h_1600,al_c,q_85,enc_avif,quality_auto/2402dd_9045f2e88e3b47a7a108b1c47a9b6937~mv2.jpeg">
    <p>I like the analogy about "mental equivalent of sweating". Learning is not just about absorbing something new. It often asks for discomfort as it often constructs a neural pathway, and with more practice, a stronger circuit, much like a muscle.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <p>I am usually slow at learning new languages. My piano classes often remind me that the pleasure of playing is real, but so is the struggle to stay with the process. Focus doesn't always feel rewarding in the moment. But without it, the joy doesn't really land. So, when my mind is already cluttered or overstimulated, it starts reaching for easier rewards—like a scroll, a headline, or a short video or reels. In that state, real learning struggles to settle in.</p>
    <img src="https://elissamilne.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/manuscript-plus-glasses.jpg?w=820">
    <p>So, I have started to keep my plate light. I explore during certain times in the day, only when my mind is clear or curious. It's like food, you need it daily, but you don't want to eat heavy meals at odd hours. Especially as I age, I don't want to consume just because it was pushed to me. I want to make a choice, when I really have the space.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <p>Some days, I still slip. And that's okay. But I always return to this idea: a quiet plate, a healthy but lighter meal, enough space to think, and a few intentional bites at a time. I still have fun with social media, like drinking or eating a heavy meal, but they have become more of intentional bites, which has its dedicated time, because when I make such rooms, learning finds its way back in.</p>

  <p><b>Tars</b> has gone for board and train in <a href="https://hachi.dog/listing/quadrant-conditioned-k9-institute/">Quadrant K9 Institute</a>. It's like a school for him. Hemanth and Jagan had been nudging me for a while, but I resisted a lot at first, convinced that his training was our responsibility alone as parents. What changed my mind was realising that our packed days were shrinking his world; if he's ever to trek and travel with us, 
  he needs space and time to explore on his own. Overtime he had grown to develop fear and anxiety around unfamiliar places without us. I cried the whole way back, but this break feels right. Seeing him running around and learn in videos eases the ache. I'm learning too to be a better parent.</p>

  <p>With BB and Chooku, he has got company, and maybe a secret plan by the three to return home. All are happy and safe</p>

  <ul>
   <li><p>With more time in hand over weekends, I've been pausing to watch movies. I've always enjoyed Thiyagaraja Kumararaja's films and interviews, so I ended up watching the <a href="https://www.primevideo.com/detail/Modern-Love-Chennai/0NK5H61EYM4LTX6IM4CMF4SQ9O"><i>Modern Love Chennai</i></a> anthology. I liked <i>Ninaivo Oru Paravai</i>. </p></li>
   <ul> <li><p>The style is unusual, it feels like a deliberate choice by the director to make it a film you can't fully grasp in one sitting. With OTT platforms, this kind of storytelling works well, with clues scattered throughout, and different doors opening each time you watch. </p></li> </ul>

  <li><p>It also inspired me to take photos of mundane, inanimate objects around me; Frames I don't usually visit, but which now feel quietly alive.I used <a href="https://www.amazon.in/Sony-ILCE-6400-24-2MP-Mirrorless-Digital/dp/B07NF3SNLT">Sony Alpha 6400 mirrorless</a></p></li>
  <li> <p>Hemanth gifted me <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukulele">Ukulele</a>. I got curious about strings, and I find it fascinating how much of its sound depend on regular tuning; even with my stiff hands, I'm enjoying the strumming and singing along. </p></li>
  <li><p>On one of the days, I spent a quiet evening on Church Street, my favorite part of the city with much memories. Picked up a few books at Blossoms and have already started Ted Chiang's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exhalation:_Stories">Exhalation</a>.</p></li>

  <p>Art has a way to yield pause to busy life. I may get bored if I stay still for a long time but this is a much needed relief.</p>

 <p>It's been a while since I wrote any notes. Work has been hectic, and while I did collate my thoughts, I never made the time to post them.</p>
   <hr/>
<div class="section"> 
 <p>I paid a visit to Chennai to receive my mom, and that trip brought with it a beautiful moment: I became an aunt. My niece, Anaika, was born, and it's already been over a month since her arrival.</p>
</div>

  <ul class="section">
    <li>The way I approach work and time management has been shaped by people I admire:</li>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Jagan</b> introduced me to empathy.</li>
      <li><b>Thejesh</b> encouraged me to reflect more and bring structure to my thoughts. He's the reason I started writing notes.</li>
      <li><b>Ellie</b> taught me how to be assertive without letting go of kindness.</li>
      <li><b>Rahul</b> showed me how clarity and empathy can go hand in hand.</li>
      <li><b>Ashwin</b> brings a quiet patience that I'm still learning from. His steady way of thinking has had a lasting impact.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <ul>
    <li>Work filled most days this month — usually starting by 9 AM and stretching past midnight. I've been getting around 6 hours of sleep, trying to move development along as much as possible. The pace has been intense, but I've enjoyed staying close to the code.</li>
    <li>I reminded myself this month that it's okay not to immediately understand everything. Just because something doesn't make sense at first glance doesn't mean it's a rule I've failed to follow.</li>

    <li>We hosted Eva for a week and it was fun. We're glad we were able to share our days with her as they prepare to move back to Kerala soon.</li>

    <li>I've noticed that quick reactions — especially through emojis — sometimes make real conversations feel distant. That disconnect between screen and self can quietly affect how we relate.</li>

    <li>One quiet frustration this month has been with how some LLMs respond — often with too much certainty, even when they're wrong. They are predictions, probabilities, not certainties. It's like working with someone who rarely admits they might be off.</li>
    <li>One of the days, we had a hackathon-style session with my cousins and a few college students. It was a fun and productive experience.</li>

    <li>I've been reading <i><a href="https://neildegrassetyson.com/books/2022-09-starry-messenger/">Starry Messenger</a></i> by Neil deGrasse Tyson and I'm thoroughly enjoying it.</li>

    <li>I've been imagining a more anchored morning — one where I wake up to small things like the weather, health stats, or key events around where I live. Not just threads of news. I've been working on a platform to bring this to life, and it's still a work in progress.</li>

    <li>Tars turned 1 on May 9th! He had a specially baked cake but unfortunately got sick the next day. Thankfully, he's recovered now.</li>

    <li>My dreams have felt more vivid lately. Some of them stay with me after I wake up, and I've started noting them down. Holding onto a sense of curiosity — even through small experiments in thought, routine, or work — has made a difference. Staying curious feels like a quiet way to stay open.</li>

    <li>It's important to remind ourselves that we are not slaves to anyone. Each country's affairs are its own, and sovereignty should be respected. Treating all people with respect is essential — there are no "aliens" among us. We are all human beings sharing this earth.</li>

    <h3>Week 21-22</h3>
    <p>I was down for most part of the weeks, realising how hard it is to collect your thoughts and write when you're not feeling well. I mostly stayed occupied with reading and watching things.</p>
    <p> Among other things:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Finished <i><a href='https://www.amazon.in/Exhalation-Stories-Ted-Chiang/dp/1101947888'>Exhalation</a></i> by Ted Chiang. </li>

   <p>Work has been steady, and focus has held up well overall. We released the first version recently , a solid step forward. I've started enjoying early mornings more, and when I'm blocked, I often end up fixing bugs late at night. I try not to pick up anything new unless I've cleared my head. I genuinely enjoy working with my team - there's a good rhythm and energy right now.</p>

    <ul>
    <li>I've been thinking about how important it is to practise “being nice” consistently at work. I remember reading a <a href='https://thejeshgn.com/2024/04/22/be-nice/'>post</a> once, for many of us, work takes up most of our lives, especially in IT. So how we communicate really matters, especially in a remote environment.</li></ul>

    <p>My MacBook's display broke on one of the weeks, and I ended up getting a new one <a href='https://www.apple.com/in/shop/buy-mac/macbook-air'>(M4 Air)</a> through an exchange. It was an unexpected expense, but the migration was surprisingly smooth. I wanted to get a <a href='https://www.lenovo.com/in/en/p/laptops/thinkpad/thinkpadt/thinkpad-t14-gen-5-14-inch-intel/21mmcto1wwin2'>ThinkPad</a> — I always liked how compact and handy it was — but it felt like too big of an investment right now. The Apple ecosystem is a big plus, and I prefer macOS/Linux over Windows any day, especially since I live in the terminal most of the time.</p>

    <p>Recently I've started recognising that even saying “I'm off social media” is a form of privilege. For most parts, it becomes an essential platform for connection and growth. So, I've been lately appreciating social connections but I am still mindful. Also, without Tars around, I found myself waking up and reaching for my phone first thing — which I end up regretting the later part of the day.</p>

    <h3>Week 23-24</h3>
    <p>Hemanth and I got to spend some good time together too. We worked out of co-working spaces most days. We also went to Church Street on one of the days, picked up a few books, and sat at the open section of <a href='https://www.zomato.com/bangalore/kling-brewery-church-street-bangalore'>Kling</a> — the food was great.</p>

    <li>The kids upstairs still drop by now and then. They danced at our apartment recently. We talk stories, they write, and I've been setting up a small space for them to feel comfortable. They mostly enjoy juices and ice creams, and they miss Tars too.</li>
    <li>Photos are one of the few ways we attempt to hold time still. They offer a glimpse into something that no longer exists, except in memory. This very thought often makes me want to take that 'click', as if preserving it might help me stay connected to it later. But I've started questioning the need to preserve everything. And most importantly, the phone gallery gets cluttered and messy. If every moment is photographed, none of them feel rare. It's been on my mind lately, and I'm open to ideas.</li>

    <li>A good friend of mine, Bobby, recently bought a house in Hebbal. I went for the housewarming and we kept it low-key. He wasn't too into the whole ceremony bit, so we just chilled with Ambili and their kid. I'm genuinely happy for him as I know how much this place means to him. We had some food and boiled milk, and I left early to pick up Tars.</li>

    <li>When Tars wasn't around, we slipped back into our old, lazy routine of waking and sleeping at odd hours. It often reminded us how much he grounded us. He's back now after a month at boarding , a bit leaner but well-fed and rested. He had a good time there, made friends, followed a routine, though he's still a little anxious. Ever since he returned, things have felt more balanced again. Even my sleep has been better for the past week. He's grumpy at times, but doing well overall. He's truly our companion.</li>

    <li>I'm not someone who regularly keeps in touch with family, and I'm not proud of it. Slowly trying to build the habit , maybe by blocking out time just for that. I already do it with one or two close friends, and I think it's time I do that with family too, especially as they're getting older.  Jagan has been exploring a really interesting space, and I'm looking forward to writing more about it once he shares his work. </li>
